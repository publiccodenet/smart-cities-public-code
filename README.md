Website for «Smart Cities? Public Code!» programme by the University of Applied Sciences Amsterdam, City of Amsterdam and the Foundation For Public Code.

This site builds with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), as is the default of [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) and uses the [Foundation For Public Code Jekyll Theme](https://github.com/publiccodenet/jekyll-theme).

```bash

## Serving Locally

1. Run the Jekyll server with 
```bash
